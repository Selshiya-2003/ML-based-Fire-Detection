# ML-based-Fire-Detection

The Machine Learning-Based Fire Detection System is a project aimed at identifying fire in images by analyzing color-based features, specifically the intensity of red and yellow pixels. Using traditional machine learning techniques, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the system achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on test images, effectively differentiating between fire and non-fire scenarios. This lightweight, efficient approach makes it suitable for real-time applications in safety monitoring, such as integrating with CCTV cameras in residential and industrial settings to detect fire hazards early. By leveraging color characteristics, this system provides a reliable, non-deep learning solution for fire detection in image-based surveillance.
